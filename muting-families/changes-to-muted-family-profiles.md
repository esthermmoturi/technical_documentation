The UI of muted family profiles updates to make the muted status clear and easily recognizable.

* The family icon turns grey
* A status of “Muted” displays on the second line below the family name
* Each of the family members in the people card are also styled as muted, (grey icons and “Muted” labels). Any actions that were previously available on the family remain available on the profile.
* Instead of the “Mute” form, there is now “Unmute”
* If an action is begun on a muted family, there will be a warning message saying “This family is currently muted. Are you sure you want to proceed?”
* A user may add a new person to a muted household. If they do, and choose to leave the family muted, the new person will be automatically muted once created.
